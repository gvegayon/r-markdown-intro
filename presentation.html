- Special thanks to the LA East RUG organizers (Malcom, Zhi, Emil, George) for injecting lots of eneRgy into the local R community.

- Up until recently I've only been a quiet consumer of the awesome content this community produces (both online and in person). 

- I hope to contribute more and this presentation is my first step in that direction. I hope you find it helpful.

# What is Markdown

--

- Created in 2004 by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/)

--

- It's a lightweight markup language to add formatting elements to plaintext

--

- Example time!

---

# What is R Markdown

--

- First introduced as part of the `knitr` package in 2012 by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/)
    - dynamic report generation

--

- Leverages [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) by [John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net/) 
    - "swiss army knife" document conversion.

--

- As of 2014, lives as it's own package `rmarkdown`
    - knitr executes the code and renders to Markdown
    - Pandoc then renders the markdown to the desired format

--

- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

???

- Markdown's simplicity made it very popular, but it was still missing some features. [John MacFarlane](https://johnmacfarlane.net/) created [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to enhance and convert markdown documents to a large variety of outputs and we have lift-off!

- Today, the package is it's own (est. 2014), thanks to Yihui and the team at RStudio, and makes use of knitr and Pandoc with:
    - knitr executing the code and rendering to Markdown
    - Pandoc rendering the output to the desired format

---

# What can R Markdown do?

- Here are the list of things it can do:

--

    - Compile a single R Markdown document to a report in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, or Word.
--

    - Create notebooks in which you can directly run code chunks interactively.
--

    - Make slides for presentations (HTML5, LaTeX Beamer, or PowerPoint).
--

    - Produce dashboards with flexible, interactive, and attractive layouts.
--

    - Build interactive applications based on Shiny.
--

    - Write journal articles.
--

    - Author books of multiple chapters.
--

    - Generate websites and blogs.

# R Markdown Examples

--

- Compile a single R Markdown document to a report in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, or Word.

--

- Make slides for presentations (HTML5, LaTeX Beamer, or PowerPoint).

--

- [Produce dashboards with flexible, interactive, and attractive layouts](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/examples.html)

--

- Generate websites and blogs!

---

# Setting up an R Blog 

--

1. `install.packages('blogdown')`

2. In RStudio, File -&gt; New Project

3. Select "Website using blogdown"

4. Provide your parameters and create your project!

--

### Tips &amp; Resources

- start simple and focus on content

- once that's working, you can play with [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)!

- [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

- [helpful slides from Yihui](https://slides.yihui.name/2017-rstudio-webinar-blogdown-Yihui-Xie.html)

---

## How do I publish?

--

- There are lots of ways and many different instructions on that.
- What's worked for me was to use [Github](https://www.github.com) and a service called [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

--

### ...the basics

1. Setup your project with git and Github
2. Create a free Netlify account and connect it to the Github repo you published to
3. Netlify will use Hugo to render your website
4. Commits to your github repo will now trigger Netlify to build and update your site automatically!

### What about a domain name?

--

- If you don't have a domain name, save yourself the headache and buy one on netlify.

--

- If you already have a domain...may god be with you. üòú

--

    - [Netlify has some decent documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/)
    
    - You can reach out to me on the [LAERUG Slack](https://laerug.slack.com) as well and I'm happy to assist.
